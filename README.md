# Technologies used
- Objective-C
- CoreData
- MapKit
- JSON
- Autolayout

# What could be improved
The app was created as a weekend project long time ago. It is production ready, updated to run in latest IDEs, but couple of things could be either added or improved.
- Adding unit tests for creation of `CoreData` stack and importing initial data
- Moving images and colors to asset catalogs
- Adding more comments to the code
- Simplifying autolayout logic in `RAFDetailViewController`
